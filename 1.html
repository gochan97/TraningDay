            and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create 
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
